# Analytics_Portfolio

I enjoy extracting insights from data and telling data-driven stories. I utilize technology to answer scientific and real-world questions.
 
So how did my journey begin? I was told as a kid that I have big dreams, but they don’t work unless I take actions. That really stuck with me and has been my motto since. I think the same way about data. It will remain just as some numbers, text, or images, unless you work with them and transform them appropriately to unveil the truth.
 
I have always been very curious, which is why I ended up in research. For research projects I did earlier on, it always sufficed to simply use ImageJ/Fiji and Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint to process the data and plot the results. So it was not until I started working with larger and more complex datasets that I (more or less) had to learn how to script/code. Well, once you have gotten a taste of how interesting data engineering can be (after all the debugging), there’s no stopping anymore.
 
I developed this analytics portfolio, as part of the [Google Data Analytics certificate](https://www.credly.com/badges/9483b79a-9dae-4ebb-be1f-d4a547cbb914/public_url), to showcase my Python projects, using libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras and Matplotlib. 
While MATLAB is the main language I used for my PhD, the analytical mindset and skills I developed in my research career will allow me to thrive in the industry:

* Data cleaning and processing
* Data analysis and visualization
* Statistical modeling and machine learning
* Project coordination & management
* Communication with diverse stakeholders
* Scientific writing, proofreading & editing
* Figure design with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop
* Teamwork and collaboration
